# CityGML-EnvPlan-ADE
The CityGML extension EnvPlan ADE is a 3D information model for integrating BIM and environmental planning. 

The CityGML EnvPlan ADE was developed in 2020 during a master thesis at the [Chair of Geoinformatics](/https://www.lrg.tum.de/en/gis/home/) at the Technical University of Munich.

The following paper provides detailed information on the CityGML EnvPlan ADE and describes use cases and their implementation in greater detail:

# More Information
[OGC CityGML](https://www.ogc.org/standards/citygml) is an open data model and XML-based format for the storage and exchange of semantic 3D city models. It is an application schema for the [Geography Markup Language version 3.1.1 (GML3)](https://www.ogc.org/standards/gml), the extendible international standard for spatial data exchange issued by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and the ISO TC211. The aim of the development of CityGML is to reach a common definition of the basic entities, attributes, and relations of a 3D city model. By means of so-called Application Domain Extensions (ADEs) the core model of CityGML can be extended systematically by application-specific attributes and object types.

CityGML is an international OGC standard and can be used free of charge.
